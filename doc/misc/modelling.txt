Modeling FAQ
============

1   Connecting to another module
--------------------------------

1.1   When should I connect to another module using a gate?

2   Finding another module in C++
---------------------------------

There are two suggested ways to find another module in C++ depending on whether
your module is connected to the other or not.

2.1   How should I find another module in C++ that is connected to my module?

You should follow the connection on the gate and cast the gate owner of the
other end to the expected C++ class.

2.2   How should I find another module in C++ that isn't connected to my module?

You should add a module path parameter to your module that specifies where the
other module is. Then you can lookup the other module using the value of this
parameter, and cast the received pointer to the expected C++ class.

3   Communicating with another module
-------------------------------------

3.1   When should I make a C++ function call to another module?

Making a C++ function call is very cheap compared to sending and processing a
cMessage through the future event queue. In general, the best way to communicate
with another module is to make a C++ function call unless something prevents it.
Obviously you can't make a function call into the future.

3.2   When should I emit and/or subscribe to an OMNeT++ signal?

You should use OMNeT++ signals when your module is sending data to multiple
recipients but not all potential receivers are connected via gates, and the
communication is more like a publish-subscribe mechanism.

3.3   When should I send a cPacket subclass instance to another module?
 
You should send a cPacket subclass instance when the data you are sending is
representing the whole or some part of a network packet.

3.4   When should I send an instance of a cMessage subclass without an attached
      control info to another module?

TODO:

3.5   When should I send a direct cMessage instance with an attached control
      info to another module?

TODO:

3.6   When should I set the message kind on a cMessage instance?

In general, you shouldn't set the message kind to communicate with peers that
are part of separate physical entities.

3.7   When should I set a context pointer on a cMessage instance?

TODO:

3.8   When should I set a parameter on a cMessage instance?

TODO:

TODO:
When network packet data goes from one module to another (with ownership transfer)
then a connection should exist! between them and a message should be animated.
