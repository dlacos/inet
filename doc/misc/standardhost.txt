- replace RegisterProtocolCommand and RegisterInterfaceCommand with C++ function
  calls to avoid having thousands of initialization messages
- move manet routing protocols up to the application layer and change them to
  use a standard UDP socket by default bound to their predefined ports
- add a manet protocol component to the transport layer which sends and receives
  IP datagrams with IP protocol number 138 and on the UDP port 269 as specified
  in RFC 5498
- the manet protocol component does multiplexing/demultiplexing as specified in
  rfc 5444 among multiple manet routing protocols
- what should we do with the sequence chart regarding the extra axes introduced
  by the packet dispatcher modules: application to transport, transport to
  network, network to link, and the one within network layer?
- implement TCP accept (by application) mechanism to allow the new incoming
  connections to be registered with packet dispatchers based on their new socket
- eliminate gate vectors from modules which do dispatching
- replace various control info interfaces with tags



 - add a real tunnel example with app/tunsocket 
 - rename StandardHost -> Host?, keep Router, AccessPoint, WirelessHost, AdhocHost
 - rename EtherSwitch to Ether(net)????????Switch?
